# Sip Finder App

## Overview

This project is a sip finder app built with Next.js 14 using the App Router. It allows users to search for cocktails,add to cocktail basket, save/remove their favorites, and view saved cocktails. The application also includes a login page to protect access to the cocktail pages with dummy users.

## Features

1. **Cocktail Search Page**:
   - A search bar to find cocktails by name.
   - Display search results with cards.
   - Each card includes a button to add the cocktail to a basket.
   - Basket is stored in RAM and cleared on page refresh.
   - A save button to add cocktails to the saved cocktails page.

2. **Saved Cocktails Page**:
   - Displays cocktails that have been saved by the user.
   - Cards are persistent and do not clear after a page refresh.
   - Users can remove cocktails from the list.

3. **Login Page**:
   - A login page with a dummy user.
   - Redirects users to the auth page if they try to access cocktail pages without being logged in.

4. **Middleware for Authentication and Authorization**:
   - **API Authentication**: Middleware checks for routes that require authentication and handles API requests accordingly.
   - **Authentication Protection**: Routes defined as authentication-required are protected, redirecting logged-in users away from the login page and ensuring only authenticated users can access protected pages.
   - **Public Routes**: Public routes are accessible without authentication.
   - **Redirection**: Users are redirected to the login page if they attempt to access protected routes without being logged in. Authenticated users are redirected away from the login page if they attempt to access it.
